## About StudyLatte

Have you ever gone to a cafe to study, work, or focus? Have you ever shared that experience with friends? There’s something about it that makes it easier and more fun. During lockdowns when everything was online, it was hard to have that experience. Inspired by “Study With Me” videos on YouTube, we have created StudyLatte.

StudyLatte is a virtual study cafe that you can join with friends. If you’re a student, remote worker, or someone who studies for fun, this app is for you. It’s motivating and easier to focus when you study together. You can motivate each other and be accountable.

In StudyLatte, everyone shares a synced up, customizable timer. There is even an instant message feature for break time. The beautiful images make the experience more immersive and relaxing. We used React, Sass, Chakra UI, and Socket IO with Express to make this experience come to life.

## Final Thoughts

There are many features we would love to add to StudyLatte, such as ambient sounds or lo-fi music. We would love to add customization options such as different backgrounds to choose from, or password-protected rooms. We also want to give users the ability to track their study time and topics, and even have a point system to motivate everyone.

Thank you for taking a look at our app. It was a huge challenge, but we’re so proud of what we accomplished. Learning how to give users a shared experience was so interesting, and we hope it will motivate everyone to study with their friends. StudyLatte can’t pour you a coffee, but it can connect you no matter where you are!
